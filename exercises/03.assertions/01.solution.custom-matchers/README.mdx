# Custom matchers

## Declaring a matcher

I will start by implementing the custom `.toMatchSchema()` matcher. This will include both extending the type definitions for `vitest` and defining the matcher logic itself.

I already have a `vitest.setup.ts` setup file in my project. I will declare my custom matcher in that setup file. And since my project uses TypeScript, I will approach this in a type-first manner:

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=0-99
import type { Schema } from 'zod'

interface CustomMatchers<MatcherResult = any> {
	toMatchSchema: (schema: Schema) => MatcherResult
}
```

Here, I am declaring a new interface called `CustomMatchers` that will describe all the custom matchers I want in my tests. It accepts the `MatcherResult` type argument, which is a requirement in order to make matchers work correctly with Vitest.

The type definition for the matcher itself describes it as a simple function that accepts a `schema` and returns the `MatchResult`. This is how you can imagine this call signature upon usage:

```ts nonumber nocopy
expect(unknown).toMatchSchema(schema) // MatcherResult
```

At the moment, this type definition exists in a vacuum. It doesn't do anything. I need to extend some of the existing types in Vitest in order for my custom matchers to be applied on the type level:

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=7-10
import type { Schema } from 'zod'

interface CustomMatchers<MatcherResult = any> {
	toMatchSchema: (schema: Schema) => MatcherResult
}

declare module 'vitest' {
	interface Assertion<T = any> extends CustomMatchers<T> {}
	interface MatchersDeclaration extends CustomMatchers {}
}
```

There are two interfaces from `vitest` that I extend using module augmentgation:

- `Assertion<T>`, which controls the matchers returned by calling `expect()`;
- `MatchersDeclaration`, which annotates the matcher declarations passed to `expect.extend()`.

This is enough for the `.toMatchSchema()` custom matcher to be recognized by TypeScript:

```ts nonumber nocopy
expect({}).toMatchSchema(mySchema) // âœ…
```

But this is only half of the story. Running this `expect()` statement will throw an error since I haven't provided the actual _implementation_ for the matcher yet. Let's fix that!

To provide a matcher implementation, call `expect.extend()` and provide it with an object that contains the definitions for your custom matchers:

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=1,13-15
import { expect } from 'vitest'
import type { Schema } from 'zod'

interface CustomMatchers<MatcherResult = any> {
	toMatchSchema: (schema: Schema) => MatcherResult
}

declare module 'vitest' {
	interface Assertion<T = any> extends CustomMatchers<T> {}
	interface MatchersDeclaration extends CustomMatchers {}
}

expect.extend({
	toMatchSchema(received, expected) {},
})
```

This is a barebones definition for any custom matcher. You can notice that the `.toMatchSchema()` function doesn't have the same call signature as I defined in the `CustomMatchers` interface. That is because Vitest will call this matcher with the additional `received` argument. That is the value passed to the assertion `expect(HERE)`.

In the matcher declaration, I will parse the given `received` object using the `expected` schema:

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=8-14 highlight=11,14
import { expect } from 'vitest'
import type { Schema } from 'zod'

// ...

expect.extend({
	toMatchSchema(received, expected) {
		const result = expected.safeParse(received)

		if (!result.success) {
			return {}
		}

		return {}
	},
})
```

By checking the `result.success` of the schema parsing, I can control the result of this matcher, failing it if the parsing was unsuccessful and marking it as passing if it wasn't.

I control the matcher result by _returning the matcher object_. Let me show you.

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=12-15,20-22
import { expect } from 'vitest'
import type { Schema } from 'zod'

// ...

expect.extend({
	toMatchSchema(received, expected) {
		const result = expected.safeParse(received)

		if (!result.success) {
			return {
				pass: false,
				message: () => 'Does not match the schema',
				actual: this.utils.printReceived(received),
				expected: result.error.format(),
			}
		}

		return {
			pass: true,
			message: () => 'Matches the schema',
			actual: this.utils.printReceived(received),
		}
	},
})
```

The matcher result tells Vitest how to treat this custom matcher and consists of the following properties:

- `pass`, a `boolean` indicating whether the `received` value matched the `expected;
- `message`, a _function_ that produces the success or error message.
- `actual`, the actual value provided to the assertion (`expect(THIS)`);
- `expected`, the expected value provided to the assertion (`expect(...).toMatchSchema(THIS)`).

<callout-info>Notice that I'm using a built-in `this.utils.printReceived()` function so that Vitest would print the given objects and schemas nicely in the test output. Explore the `this.utils` object to discover more helpers to write great custom matchers!</callout-info>

This concludes the implementation of my custom matcher! ðŸŽ‰

All that is left to do for it to work is to make sure that the `vitest.setup.ts` file is indeed used as the setup in Vitest:

```ts filename=vitest.config.ts add=7
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
	test: {
		globals: true,
		environment: 'node',
		setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
	},
})
```

## Refactoring tests

Now I can finally refactor my `fetch-user.test.ts` tests to benefit from the custom matcher.

```ts filename=src/fetch-user.test.ts remove=6-12 add=14
import { fetchUser } from './fetch-user'
import { userSchema } from './schemas'

test('returns the user by id', async () => {
	const user = await fetchUser('abc-123')
	const result = userSchema.safeParse(user)

	expect(result.error).toBeUndefined()
	expect(result.data).toEqual({
		id: 'abc-123',
		name: 'John Maverick',
	})

	expect(user).toMatchSchema(userSchema)
})
```

<callout-success>Notice that unlike custom test context, you _don't have to import a custom version of the `expect()` function_. Matchers are extended in-place and available the same way as your regular `expect()` function, which in our case is globally (due to `test.globals: true` in `vitest.config.ts`).</callout-success>

This transforms a test case riddled with implementation details into a descriptive and concise reflection of what I expect from the `fetchUser()` function. All thanks to the power of custom matchers.
