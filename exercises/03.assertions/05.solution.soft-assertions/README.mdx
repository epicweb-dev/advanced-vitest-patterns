# Soft assertions

A _soft assertion_ is a type of assertion that doesn't short-circuit your test case when it fails. Instead, all failed soft assertions are reported at the end of the test run at once.

> 🦉 The concept of soft assertions isn't new, and you can find it in other programming languages. Somehow, it's not as widespread in JavaScript, which is a shame we will try collectively to correct.

You can turn any assertion into a soft assertion in Vitest by replacing `expect()` with `expect.soft()`:

```ts filename=src/user.test.ts remove=5-8,16-17 add=9-12,18-19
test('cancels the user subscription', () => {
	const user = new User()
	user.subscribe(new UnlimitedPlan())

	expect(user.subscription.name).toBe('Unlimited')
	expect(user.subscription.kind).toBe('yearly')
	expect(user.subscription.state).toBe('active')
	expect(user.subscription.endsAt).toBeUndefined()
	expect.soft(user.subscription.name).toBe('Unlimited')
	expect.soft(user.subscription.kind).toBe('yearly')
	expect.soft(user.subscription.state).toBe('active')
	expect.soft(user.subscription.endsAt).toBeUndefined()

	user.cancelSubscription()

	expect(user.subscription.state).toBe('cancelled')
	expect(user.subscription.endsAt).toBe('2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z')
	expect.soft(user.subscription.state).toBe('cancelled')
	expect.soft(user.subscription.endsAt).toBe('2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z')
})
```

In the case of the subscription service test, both assertions around the current subscription state and the cancelled state _reflect the same expectation_ that requires _multiple criteria_ to be fully expressed.

> 💡 If you imagine regular assertions as `await new Promise(expectation)`, then soft assertions are [`await Promise.allSettled(...expectations)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled).

With the soft assertions in place, I can now see _all_ failed assertions after the test run is complete:

```txt nocopy highlight=4-13,20-29
 FAIL  src/user.test.ts > cancels the user subscription
AssertionError: expected 'active' to be 'cancelled' // Object.is equality

Expected: "cancelled"
Received: "active"

 ❯ src/user.test.ts:24:39
     22|  user.cancelSubscription()
     23|
     24|  expect.soft(user.subscription.state).toBe('cancelled')
       |                                       ^
     25|  expect.soft(user.subscription.endsAt).toBe('2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z')
     26| })

Expected: "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"

 ❯ src/user.test.ts:25:40
     23|
     24|  expect.soft(user.subscription.state).toBe('cancelled')
     25|  expect.soft(user.subscription.endsAt).toBe('2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z')
       |                                        ^
     26| })
     27|
```

This gives me an overview of the entire system, not just the first failed assertion. Equipped with that knowledge, I can fix the issue as a whole instead of solving each failed assertion individually.

```ts filename=src/plans.ts add=6,10-12
	public cancel() {
		if (this.state !== 'active') {
			return
		}

		this.state = 'cancelled'

		const today = new Date()
		today.setUTCDate(1)
		today.setUTCMonth(
			today.getUTCMonth() + 1 > 11 ? 0 : today.getUTCMonth() + 1,
		)

		if (today.getUTCMonth() === 0) {
			today.setUTCFullYear(today.getUTCFullYear() + 1)
		}

		this.endsAt = today.toISOString()
	}
```

## When to use soft assertions

Soft assertions are tremendously useful because they give you more information on test failures. But that doesn't mean you should make all assertions soft. In fact, that would be quite a disasterous thing to do.

Both regular and soft assertions are valuable, and they are valuable precisely due to the difference in their behavior. Below, I will give you a few examples so you would know when to reach out for each.

| Regular assertions                                                                                                           | Soft assertions                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use to express a _hard expectation_. In other words, if this assertion fails, there's no reason to run the rest of the test. | Use to express a single, non-exclusive criteria in a _compound expectation_. In other words, if this assertion fails, there is more to this expectation to paint a full picture. |

Regular assertions are your _hard stops_ in a test, which also makes all such assertions _dependent on each other_.

```ts nonumber nocopy
// This assertion must pass...
expect(one).toBe(two)
// ...in order for this to run, which must pass...
expect(three).toBe(four)
// ...in order for this to run.
expect(five).toBe(six)
```

> This allows you to create a waterfall of expectations.

Soft assertions, on the other hand, have no such dependency and will run in parallel. This characteristic makes them a great choice for expressing compound expectations or expectations toward multiple, independent states.

```ts nonumber nocopy
renderIntialState()
await transition(nextState)

// In this example, soft assertions are used to describe
// multiple criteria of the same expectation.
expect.soft(state.one).toBe('this')
expect.soft(state.two).toBe('that')
```

```ts nonumber nocopy
await goto(page.url)
await interact()

// Here, we are expressing multiple expectations toward DIFFERENT
// states (in this case, different elements on the page).
// The heading and the button aren't interconnected and should be
// asserted independently.
expect.soft(headingElement).toHaveTextContent('Welcome to my site!')
expect.soft(buttonElement).toHaveTextContent('Subscribe to my newsletter')
```
