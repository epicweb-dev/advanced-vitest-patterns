# Custom equality testers

Much like custom matchers, custom equality testers live in the setup file, which in our case is `vitest.setup.ts`. To extend the built-in equality logic (the one used by `.toEqual()`), I will call the `expect.addEqualityTesters()` function and provide it with a list of custom equality testers.

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=3
import { Measurement } from './src/measurement'

expect.addEqualityTesters([])
```

Every item in this list represents an _equality tester_ function that Vitest will exhaust before treating two values as not equal.

I will declare a new tester called `measurementTester` to teach Vitest how to compare `Measurement` instances.

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=4
import { Measurement } from './src/measurement'

expect.addEqualityTesters([
	function measurementTester(received, expected) {
		// ...
	},
])
```

Every equality tester accepts two arguments:

- `received`, which is the actual value (the left-most part of the comparison);
- `expected`, which is the expected value (the right-most part).

This is how they translate to an assertion in your tests:

```ts nonumber nocopy
//     ðŸ‘‡ received                       ðŸ‘‡ expected
expect(new Measurement(1, 'in')).toEqual(new Measurement(2.54, 'cm'))
//     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Vitest will automatically provide these two values to your equality tester function and expect it to _return a boolean_ indicating whether these two values are equal.

Measurement comparison only becomes relevant if both the `received` and `expected` values are instances of the `Measurement` class. Let's make sure to check that:

```ts file=vitest.setup.ts add=5-7
import { Measurement } from './src/measurement'

expect.addEqualityTesters([
	function measurementTester(received, expected) {
		if (received instanceof Measurement && expected instanceof Measurement) {
			// ...
		}
	},
])
```

Now, to the equality!

If you take a closer look at the implementation of the `Measurement` class, it already has an `.equals()` method to help with the comparison.

```ts filename=src/measurement.ts nonumber nocopy highlight=3
export class Measurement {
	constructor(...) {}
	public equals(other: Measurement): boolean {...}
}
```

So the actual value comparison becomes a matter of invoking that `.equals()` method on any of the measurements provided by the tester:

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=6
import { Measurement } from './src/measurement'

expect.addEqualityTesters([
	function measurementTester(received, expected) {
		if (received instanceof Measurement && expected instanceof Measurement) {
			return expected.equals(received)
		}
	},
])
```

> The values you will be comparing might not have the `.equals()` method (or not be classed at all!). Feel free to implement the comparison logic directly in your custom equality tester if that's the case.

Once this is done, I don't have to do anything extra for Vitest to respect my custom equality tester. In fact, if I run tests now, I will see them passing, which means Vitest can compare measurements correctly!

## Equality testers vs Matchers

Let's iterate over the difference between _equality testers_ and _matchers_ to help you know when you need one over the other.

| Custom equality tester                                                               | Custom matcher                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extends the `.toEqual()` logic.                                                      | Implement entirely custom logic.                                                                                  |
| Automatically applied recursively (e.g. if your measurement is nested in an object). | Always applied explicitly. Nested usage is enabled through asymmetric matchers (`{ value: expect.myMatcher() }`). |
| Must always be _synchronous_.                                                        | Can be both synchronous and asynchronous, utilizing the `.resolves.` and `.rejects.` chaning.                     |

Custom equality testers, as the name implies, are your go-to choice to help Vitest compare values that cannot otherwise be compared by sheer serialization (like our `Measurement`, or, for example, `Response` instances).

Custom matchers are generally more powerful and are reserved for expressing custom matching logic that can often be complex and compound (like reflecting a domain requirement in tests: `expect(user).toBeAuthenticated()`).
