# Profiling slow tests

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-vitest-patterns/performance/04-01-problem/solution" />

With the `vitest-profiler` plugin added to my `vitest.config.ts`, I can run the tests in the profiler mode to see what takes them so long.

```sh nonumber
npx vitest-profiler npm test
```

> Or using `npm run test:profile` script I have in my `package.json`.

This will run my tests in a special way, enabling performance profiling in Vitest. Let's be a bit more specific as to what `vitest-profiler` actually does:

1. Spawns your test suite with Node.js performance profiling options enabled (e.g. <span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>[`--cpu-prof`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--cpu-prof))</span>. This allows it to measure Vitest performance as it runs your tests.
1. Attaches similar profiling flags to individual threads/forks that run your tests. This measures the performance of individual test files.
1. Emits CPU and heap profiles gathered from the test run.

This is what it looks like when the profiler is finished running:

```txt nonumber highlight=9-16
 ✓ src/rows.test.ts (1 test) 584ms
   ✓ retrieves all the rows  583ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  1 passed (1)
   Start at  11:13:35
   Duration  757ms (transform 18ms, setup 0ms, collect 13ms, tests 584ms, environment 0ms, prepare 32ms)

Test profiling complete! Generated the following profiles:

  main-thread:
    - CPU:      /test-profiles/2025-04-21--09-13-35--main-thread.cpuprofile

  tests:
    - CPU:      /test-profiles/2025-04-21--09-13-35--tests.cpuprofile
    - Heap:     /test-profiles/2025-04-21--09-13-35--tests.heapprofile
```

> I've highlighted the additional report added by `vitest-profiler`. We are going to take a deeper look into it in a moment.

Next, let's analyze the report, starting from what all of this information actually means.

## Time metrics

The first important piece of data I will look at is the _time metrics_ from Vitest:

```txt nonumber highlight=4
 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  1 passed (1)
   Start at  11:13:35
   Duration  757ms (transform 18ms, setup 0ms, collect 13ms, tests 584ms, environment 0ms, prepare 32ms)
```

This information is available each time you run your tests and is not exclusive to the profiling mode. Here, Vitest accumulates the time it took to run your tests and splits it in several groups:

- `transform`, the time it took to transform your tests. For example, transpile TypeScript to JavaScript or JSX to `React.createElement()` calls;
- `setup`, the time it took to run your `setupFiles`;
- `collect`, the time it took to locate all the test files on disk;
- `tests`, the time it took to actually run your test cases;
- `environment`, the time it took to set up and tear down your test environment;
- `prepare`, the time it took for Vitest to prepare the test runner.

This overview is a fantastic starting point in identifying which areas of your test run are the slowest. For instance, I can see that Vitest spent most time _running the tests_:

```txt nonumber highlight=4
transform 18ms,
setup 0ms,
collect 13ms,
tests 584ms,
environment 0ms,
prepare 32ms
```

> Your test duration summary will likely be different. See which phases took the most time to know where you should direct your further investigation. For example, if the `setup` phase is too slow, it may be because your test setup is too heavy and should be refactored. If `collect` is lagging behind, it may mean that Vitest has trouble scraping your large monorepo and you should help it locate the test files by providing explicit `include` and `exclude` options in your Vitest configuration.

With this covered, let's move on to the `vitest-profiler` report.

## Profiler report

`vitest-profiler` gathers CPU and memory profiles for two things:

- **Main thread**, which is a Node.js process that spawned Vitest. This roughly corresponds to the `prepare`, `collect`, `transform`, and `environment` phases from the Vitest's time metrics;
- **Tests**, which is individual threads/forks that ran your test files. This roughly corresponds to the `tests` time metric.

These separate profiles allow you to take a peek behind the curtain of your test runtime. You can get an idea of what your testing framework is doing and what your tests are doing, and, hopefully, spot the root cause for that nasty performance degradation.

CPU and memory profiles reflect different aspects of your test run:

- **CPU profile** shows you the CPU consumption. This will generally point you toward code that takes too much time to run;
- **Memory (or heap) profile** shows you the memory consumption. This is handy to watch for memory leaks and heaps that can also negatively impact your test performance.

Next, I will explore each individual profile in more detail.

### Main thread profiles

One of the first things the profiler reports is a CPU profile for the main thread:

```txt nonumber highlight=4
Test profiling complete! Generated the following profiles:

  main-thread:
    - CPU:      /test-profiles/2025-04-21--09-13-35--main-thread.cpuprofile

  tests:
    - CPU:      /test-profiles/2025-04-21--09-13-35--tests.cpuprofile
    - Heap:     /test-profiles/2025-04-21--09-13-35--tests.heapprofile
```

This profile represents the CPU usage of the Vitest's main process (the one that collects the test files, prepares the runner, runs the test environment, etc). I can open that file in any tooling that supports the `*.cpuprofile` format, like the built-in "Profiler" in my browser, or I can also open it directly in Visual Studio Code!

Here's how the CPU profile for the main thread looks like:

> Now, if this looks intimidating, don't worry. Profiles will often contain a big chunk of pointers and stack traces you don't know or understand because they reflect the state of the _entire process_.

In these profiles, I am interested in spotting _abnormally long execution times_. Luckily, this report is sorted by "Total Time" automatically for me! That being said, I see nothing suspicious in the main thread so I proceed to the other profiles.

### Test profiles

When it comes to the test performance, `vitest-profiler` reports two metrics: CPU and memory profiles. Here's how they look for my test run:

![A screenshot of the CPU profile for the tests opened in Visual Studio Code.](/assets/05-01-cpuprofile-tests.png)

> (Above) The CPU profile for the tests.

![A screenshot of the heap profile for the tests opened in Visual Studio Code.](/assets/05-01-heapprofile-tests.png)

> (Above) The memory (heap) profile for the tests.

While the memory consumption looks alright, I can spot from the CPU profile that the `expensiveCompute` function took a whole _444ms_ to run. That is _a lot_!

My next steps will be to see what makes the `expensiveCompute` function so slow and whether the person who named it that was was really trying to tell us something.

## Conclusion

Like every bug, every performance degradation is different. I cannot outline a single "one size fits all" approach to your problem as much as I want to. Ultimately, _you_ are the best person to do that. You are infinitely more familiar with your project, its setup, dependencies, and technical debt than I can ever be.

What I can do is teach you where to get started, and now that you know how to profile your tests, you are one step closer to fixing any performance issue you will find.

What I can also do is give you a rough idea about approaching issues based on their problem surface:

| CPU                                                             | Memory                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analyze your expensive logic and refactor it where appropriate. | Analyze the problematic logic to see why it leaks memory.                                                                                                             |
| Take advantage of asynchronicity and parallelization.           | Fix improper memory management (e.g. rogue child processes, unterminated loops, forgotten timers and intervals, etc).                                                |
| Use caching where appropriate.                                  | In your test setup, be cautious about closing test servers or databases. Prefer scoping mocks to individual tests and deleting them completely once the test is done. |
