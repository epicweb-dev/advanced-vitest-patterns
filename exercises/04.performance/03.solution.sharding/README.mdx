# Sharding

To enable sharding, we need to change the way we run Vitest:

1. Provide the [`--shard`](https://main.vitest.dev/guide/cli#shard) option to the Vitest CLI, describing which shard group this process should run. For example, to run the first quarter of the tests, use `--shard=1/4`; the second quarter will be `--shard=2/4`, and so on.
1. Use [`--reporter=blob`](https://main.vitest.dev/guide/reporters#blob-reporter) because it's required to support sharding.

These changes can be illustrated in a simple Bash script. Let's call it `run-tests.sh`:

```sh filename=run-tests.sh
npx vitest --reporter=blob --shard=1/4 & \
npx vitest --reporter=blob --shard=2/4 & \
npx vitest --reporter=blob --shard=3/4 & \
npx vitest --reporter=blob --shard=4/4 & \
wait
```

<callout-info>In this exercise, we are using a script to illustrate a sharded test run. On CI, you can put each individual `npx vitest` command from above into a separate job, splitting the entire test suite into multiple shards.</callout-info>

Then, to run all the tests I will run that script in my terminal:

```
./run-tests.sh
```

This script will split the test suite in four shard and run them in parallel (`&`), producing isolated test reports.

<callout-success>Sharding is particularly useful in CI. If you have a large test suite that takes 8s to complete, splitting it into four groups and four parallel CI jobs can speed up the tests up to _four times_.</callout-success>

## Merging test reports

But since sharding splits our test suite, we need to glue it back together when previewing the results of the test run.

Use the [`--merge-reports`](https://main.vitest.dev/guide/cli#merge-reports) flag in the Vitest CLI to merge multiple sharded test reports into one:

```
npx vitest run --merge-reports
```

This command will print the test summary as you're used to see from Vitest:

```
 ✓ src/two.test.ts (5000 tests) 2654ms
 ✓ src/one.test.ts (5000 tests) 2647ms

 Test Files  2 passed (2)
      Tests  10000 passed (10000)
   Start at  11:36:43
   Duration  24ms (transform 0ms, setup 0ms, collect 74ms, tests 5.30s, environment 0ms, prepare 138ms)
```

<callout-success>You can persist the `.vitest-reports` directory as an artifact between different jobs so you can generate the test summary once they are done.</callout-success>

> Note that there's currently [a bug](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/7825) in Vitest that displays the total test run incorrectly when merging reports.
