# Setup

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-vitest-patterns/setup/01-00-introduction" />

<callout-success>Proficiency with any tool starts from the proper configuration.</callout-success>

Let's kick things off by getting you more productive with Vitest. Specifically, focusing on the following areas:

1. Make you write, iterate, and debug tests faster;
1. Reuse Vitest for testing different code with different requirements;
1. Help you find problematic areas in your code with code coverage.

Every exercise in this block will focus on one of the topics above. It's time for you to switch to the `/playground` directory and let the workshop commence!
