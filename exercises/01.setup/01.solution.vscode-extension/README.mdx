# Visual Studio Code extension

There is a couple of things that the Vitest extension enables you to do.

## Running tests inline

Now, you can go to any test case in your project and click on the green "run" icon next to the test's name to run it inline. Vitest will report the test results right next to the test.

Alternatively, head to the "Testing" tab of your editor and use the extension controls to run, watch, and debug any test suites or test cases you need:

## Continuous run

Start a continuous run of your tests by going to the "Testing" tab and clicking on the "Start Continuous Run" button (with the eye icon) in the controls panel of the extension. You will be prompted to choose test files to run in continuous (i.e. watch) mode.

Once the continuous run is active, you will see the test results _immediately_ as you work on your code or write your tests, both in the terminal and next to the failing assertions. This makes for a lightning-fast feedback loop when testing.

## Debugging failed tests

You can start a pre-configured debugging session for any test by clicking on the "Debug Test" button next to the failing test (or, alternatively, debug all tests via the "Debug Tests" button on the top panel). Use debuggers, breakpoints, and Debug Console to hunt down those nasty bugs and fix them.
