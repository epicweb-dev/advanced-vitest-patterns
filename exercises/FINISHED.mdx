# Advanced Vitest Patterns

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/advanced-vitest-patterns/advanced-vitest-patterns-workshop-outro/99-outro" />

Hooray! You've completed the Advanced Vitest Patterns workshop 👏👏

I hope you enjoyed the exercises and learned a great deal about Vitest and how to customize it to create great test experiences. Whether it's tackling complexity through custom fixtures and assertions, expressing your expectations more efficiently with soft and retryable assertions, or diving head-on into profiling slow tests and tweaking your test runner's defaults.

As always, there's so much more things to cover. I strongly encourage you to stay hungry and keep exploring Vitest! What you have learned today is a solid foundation to build upon and apply to your day-to-day testing craft.

I cannot wait to cover more testing topics with you in the future, and until then stay safe and write good tests :wave:
