# Custom fixtures

Once I've got `@faker-js/faker` installed, I will head to a newly created `test-extend.ts` module and implement my custom fixture.

When it comes to any API design, I like approaching it _usage-first_. I create the usage experience I want and then deal with the implementation details to bring that vision to life. This custom fixture is no exception.

In `test-extend.ts`, I will define a new type called `Fixtures` and use it to describe my custom fixture's name and its call signature:

```ts filename=test-extend.ts add=1-3
interface Fixtures {
	createMockCart: (items: Array<Partial<CartItem>>) => Cart
}
```

Above, I've declared a single custom fixture called `createMockCart`, which is a function that accepts an array of cart `items` and returns a cart object. I plan on using that fixture to help me mock different states of the cart in tests.

Now it's time to implement it.

Custom fixtures in Vitest work by extending the default `test()` function using the `test.extend()` method:

```ts filename=test-extend.ts add=1,7
import { test as testBase } from 'vitest'

interface Fixtures {
	createMockCart: (items: Array<Partial<CartItem>>) => Cart
}

export const test = testBase.extend<Fixtures>({})
```

> I am importing the `test` function under the `testBase` alias to prevent name collision with my custom `test` function.

The `test.extend()` method accepts an object that represents my custom fixtures. By providing the `Fixtures` type as the type argument to that method, I am letting Vitest know about my fixtures' type definitions.

Let's add the implementation for the `createMockCart()` fixture.

Despite the call signature of my fixture making it a simple function, the actual implementation for it will be a bit different. You can imagine the fixture implementation as a _higher-order function_ that allow you to hook into Vitest's existing context and internals, as well as control any side effects required to run _before_ and _after_ your fixture:

```ts
async exampleFixture({}, use) {
	await somethingYouNeedBefore()
	await use(fixtureValueItself)
	await somethingYouNeedAfter()
}
```

> Think of the fixture implementation as a single function encompassing three steps: `before` fixture, `use` fixture (its value), and `after` fixture (e.g. cleanup).

With this structure in mind, here's how my `createMockCart` fixture implementation will look like:

```ts filename=test-extend.ts add=9-13
import { test as testBase } from 'vitest'
import type { Cart, CartItem } from './src/cart-utils'

interface Fixtures {
	createMockCart: (items: Array<Partial<CartItem>>) => Cart
}

export const test = testBase.extend<Fixtures>({
	async createMockCart({}, use) {
		await use((items) => {
			/* ... */
		})
	},
})
```

It doesn't need anything before or after itself, so the only thing I'll do is provide the `createMockCart` implementation inline to the `use()` call.

<callout-warning>The `use()` function is _always asynchronous_ and you _must `await` it_!</callout-warning>

Calling `use()` in your fixture implementation _exposes any given argument as the value of that fixture_. This is where Vitest infers the expected type of your fixture from the `Fixtures` interface!

This is also where TypeScript will start screaming at me because my fixture doesn't do what I described in types 😬 Let's fix that.

```ts filename=test-extend.ts add=2,12-18
import { test as testBase } from 'vitest'
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker'
import type { Cart, CartItem } from './src/cart-utils'

interface Fixtures {
	createMockCart: (items: Array<Partial<CartItem>>) => Cart
}

export const test = testBase.extend<Fixtures>({
	async createMockCart({}, use) {
		await use((items) => {
			return items.map((item) => ({
				id: faker.string.ulid(),
				name: faker.commerce.productName(),
				price: faker.number.int({ min: 1, max: 25 }),
				quantity: faker.number.int({ min: 1, max: 10 }),
				...item,
			}))
		})
	},
})
```

Here, I am maping over the given `items` and making sure that each cart item has complete values. I am using the `faker` object to generate random values so I don't have to describe the entire cart item if my test case is interested only in some of its properties, like `price` and `quantity`, for example.

Finally, to use this custom test context and my fixture, I'll go to the `src/cart-utils.test.ts` test file and import the custom `test` function I've created:

```ts filename=src/cart-utils.test add=1
import { test } from '../test-extend'
import { getTotalPrice } from './cart-utils'
```

With this function at hand, I can write the first test for the `getTotalPrice()` behavior:

```ts filename=src/cart-utils.test add=4-11 highlight=4-8
import { test } from '../test-extend'
import { getTotalPrice } from './cart-utils'

test('returns the total price for the cart', ({ createMockCart }) => {
	const cart = createMockCart([
		{ price: 5, quantity: 10 },
		{ price: 8, quantity: 4 },
	])

	expect(getTotalPrice(cart)).toBe(82)
})
```

I am grabbing the `createMockCart()` fixture right from the test context, which is super neat! I provide it with two cart items of fixed `price` and `quantity` to model the exact test scenario while leaving the rest of the properties to `faker`. With this setup, I can write the expectation around the total price to be `82`.

<callout-warning>Custom fixtures _must be accessed via destructuring the test context_ (i.e. `({ one }) => {}` and _not_ `(ctx) => ctx.one`). Vitest, just like Playwright, uses a getter Proxy that lets it know whether your test is using certain fixtures or not. This allows it to skip the initialization and cleanup of those fixtures that aren't used.</callout-warning>

## Best practices of custom fixtures

Your fixtures can be anything, from static values to helper functions like our `createMockCart()`. This makes them extremely powerful. Unfortunately, that very power can poison your test setup, turning your fixtures into something that _damages the quality of your tests_.

Below, I've prepared a few rules you can follow to ensure awesome custom fixtures.

### Static values

As a rule of thumb, **DO NOT** use fixtures to abstract reused values.

```ts remove=1-3 add=4-7
test('returns the total price for the cart', ({ cart }) => {
	expect(getTotalPrice(cart)).toBe(82) // ❌
})
test('returns the total price for the cart', ({ createMockCart }) => {
	const cart = createMockCart([...]) // ✅
	expect(getTotalPrice(cart)).toBe(82)
})
```

It's tempting to put a single `cart` object into a fixture since many tests may need the same cart. But what _is_ `cart` in this particular test? Why its total price is `82` and not, say, `4` or `987`?

The `cart` fixture effectively becomes a _shared state_. If you change its value, it will affect multiple tests. By nature, `cart` is _not_ a static value and it doesn't belong in a fixture.

<callout-success>Use fixtures to _help create values_ but always make the values _known in the context of the test_. Everything the test needs has to be known and controlled within that test.</callout-success>

Once exception to this rule is _resused value that is never going to change_ within the same test run. For example, if you're testing against different locales of your application, you might want to set the `locale` before the test run and expose its value as a fixture:

```ts highlight=1
test('...', ({ locale }) => {})
```

> The value of `locale` is fixed to the test run and will never change. Different tests do not need different `locale`. It's a completely static fixture and as such it doesn't act as a shared state.

### Dynamic values

**DO** use fixtures to generate dynamic values.

```ts remove=1-15 add=16-22
test('returns the total price for the cart', () => {
	const cart = [
		{
			id: 1,
			name: 'This is irrelevant',
			price: 5,
			quantity: 10
		},
		{
			id: 2,
			...
		}
	] // ❌
	expect(getTotalPrice(cart)).toBe(82)
})
test('returns the total price for the cart', ({ createMockCart }) => {
	const cart = createMockCart([
		{ price: 5, quantity: 10 },
		{ price: 8, quantity: 4 }
	]) // ✅
	expect(getTotalPrice(cart)).toBe(82)
})
```

In fact, custom fixtures is a great way to trim down the input of your test only to the things it actually needs. Like in our `getTotalPrice` test case, the only required input is the `price` and `quantity` of cart items. The test doesn't care what are items' `name` or `id` and so it doesn't declare them. Instead, it outsources those irrelevant values to `faker` so the cart items _remain realistic_ but don't pollute the test case.

<callout-success>Since you can perform side effects before and after your fixture, you can implement all sorts of functionality in them: preparing a mock file on the disk, configuring your API mocking, spinning up a database instance with pre-defined tables.</callout-success>
